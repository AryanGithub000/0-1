//Git/Github 

use wsl in CMD line
then use git to access git and check version control etc

ls -> check files
cd -> go in path
cd .. -> go back a step

git init -> initializes git in your project folder
ls .git -> . means a hidden folder and we can access like this

touch -> creates a file

git status -> checks whether a file will be pushed to Github 
also verifies whether it will be added at the current date/time etc and put on staging area currently

but we want ppl to know we changed things so and not have untracked files

git add filename -> adds to history and now can be saved after this 

git commit -m "file added or sany text to show" -> commits the file

cat fimename -> prints what is in the file in CLI

now if i use git status it shows that the file is modified
so we use git add . to save it



git log -> gets the log of history and changes made by user on the file
rm -rf filename -> removes the file

git reset CODE -> code is a long reference no of the transaction that was done and we can use to rollback to a certain part of hostory from there
this changes the master and all commits above this are at the UNSTAGED area.

git stash -> used to store as a stash and not exactly in the main root folder 
now all files we have stashed from woeking directory to use later on

git stash pop -> gets all from unstaged to staging area and now can use them

git stash clear -> remove the files in our stash and they are gone now puffff

git remote add origin "github link" ->  Adds a remote location to repo
git remote -v -> checks and adds the fetch and push
git push origin master -> pushed to main repo
//this creates the REPO

all the code pushed is on a new branch but not on default branch as it is not finalized yet

git clone FILENAME -> clones and forks files
copy of the folder in my file 

git remote add upstream -> specifies from where i have forked the project/folder etc

PULL Requests

git branch ANYNAME -> create a new branch
git checkout NAME -> move head to that branch now to work upon


Now to merge this branch into the main branch of our project
So how to do that??

git commit -m aryan -> new branch named aryan 
git commit -m "files added on aryan branch"

now this can be merged on the main pull request to master branch

git push origin aryan -f -> pushes into origin master 

NOW if i want to update my fork part wala code to the latest as per code base then go to upstream


Q. What are merge ccinflicts?
