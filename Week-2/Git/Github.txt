//Git/Github 

use wsl in CMD line
then use git to access git and check version control etc

ls -> check files
cd -> go in path
cd .. -> go back a step

git init -> initializes git in your project folder
ls .git -> . means a hidden folder and we can access like this

touch -> creates a file

git status -> checks whether a file will be pushed to Github 
also verifies whether it will be added at the current date/time etc

but we want ppl to know we changed things so and not have untracked files

git add filename -> adds to history and now can be saved after this 

git commit -m "file added or sany text to show" -> commits the file

cat fimename -> prints what is in the file in CLI

now if i use git status it shows that the file is modified
so we use git add . to save it



git log -> gets the log of history and changes made by user on the file
rm -rf filename -> removes the file

git reset CODE -> code is a long reference no of the transaction that was done and we can use to rollback to a certain part of hostory from there
this changes the master and all commits above this are at the UNSTAGED area.

git stash -> used to store as a stash and not exactly in the main root folder 

git stash pop -> gets all from unstaged to staging area
